There were two dominant flightlines: one that was quite high and passing basically directly overhead the Seawatch. I started counting this flightline individually and quickly had to switch the clicker to 10s. I tallied just under 6000 loons on this high line. It was a gorgeous charismatic flight, and I am not exaggerating when I say that the few early-morning passers-by I was able to point the spectacle out to were moved religiously. However, I suspected that, with light west winds, the outer bay loon line (which does not intersect with the ""high line"") would be even busier. It was. I decided the best way to deal with this would be to plant the scope on one point within that line for thirty-second intervals every 4 minutes and thus calculate numbers for that flightline. The rate of loons stayed quite steady: in most 30-second intervals I recorded 110-150 loons, though I got as low as 70 in an interval and as high as 195 in an interval. The light was quite good for this part of the count, and I was able to see about as far to the west as you ever can here. Grateful for that. In the close loon flocks the composition was overwhelmingly Pacific, and I was able to pick out adult Red-throats from most reaches of the distant line.","For day's cumulative totals + narrative see https://ebird.org/tripreport/173820",NA,5.8162,"2","N",2023-11-23 07:00:00,10000
