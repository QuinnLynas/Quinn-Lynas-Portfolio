## Experience

I have hands-on experience with **data analysis tools** like R, SAS, and Excel, as well as programming experience in Java. Most of my data visualization work has been in R, where I use **ggplot2** to turn complex datasets into clear, engaging visuals.

During my time at CSUMB, I completed several projects that highlight my skillsâ€”from building statistical models and cleaning large datasets to creating interactive visualizations and sharing results through presentations. These projects show not only my technical abilities, but also my ability to communicate insights and solve real-world problems with data.
