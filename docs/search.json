    "text": "Data Description: I sourced my data from kaggle. The website is here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting/data. My data has information on sales of a large retailer from 2015 through 2019. This includes customer information and location, information on what the customer purchased, and how much was spent on the purchase. I want answer the following questions:\n\nWhat type of products were the most purchased between 2015 and 2019?\nWhat state had the most products purchased?\nHow does the market in California look and has it changed?\nHow are sales distributed between different sub-categories?\n\nData Visualization: I want some sort of time series visualizations so that we can see changes over time. I am guessing a line graph or scatter plot will work well for this, with the date on the x-axis. For my second research question a bar chart will work. For my third research question I will have to visualize using a graph that shows proportion well. I wanted to do a sankey/alluvial plot for this one. Missing data shouldn’t be an issue.\nData Cleaning: The data set I am looking at has 9800 rows of information. I will need to fix the zip codes, some of them are missing and some only have 4 digits. I will need to manually fix this. After the zips are fixed, I will match the zip codes with data from the “zipdata” library, which has longitude and latitude information for each zip. I will also be looking at state and overall U.S. longitude and latitude coordinates so that I can answer question 2.\nResearch Question 1: What type of products were the most sold between 2015 and 2019?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question 2: What state has the most products purchased?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question 3: How does the market in California look and has it changed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch Question 4: How are sales distributed between different sub-categories?",
