    "text": "Hi, I’m Quinn! I’m a recent Statistics grad from California State University, Monterey Bay, and I love turning messy data into insights that actually mean something. For me, it’s all about finding patterns, telling stories through visuals, and helping people make smarter decisions with data that’s clear and actionable.\nThrough school and research, I’ve built a strong foundation in statistical modeling, data visualization, and analysis using R and SAS. I’ve tackled a variety of projects—from studying NBA coach effectiveness with mixed-effects models to simulating pickleball tournaments for performance insights. Along the way, I’ve written R functions, cleaned big datasets, and shared results through visuals and presentations. I also use GitHub for version control and collaboration, and I’m always looking to sharpen my skills in areas like Bayesian inference, survey design, and statistical computing.\nPeople I’ve worked with usually describe me as reliable, detail-oriented, and easy to team up with. I like digging deep into data, but I also keep an eye on the bigger picture. Whether it’s coordinating on a construction site or presenting research findings, I bring curiosity, accountability, and a collaborative mindset to the table.\nHere are a few of the skills I bring:\n\nData Analysis ▪ Statistical Modeling ▪ Data Visualization ▪ Linear Regression ▪ Mixed-Effects Models\nI’m always excited to take on new challenges, learn something new, and apply my skills in meaningful ways. If you’d like to connect or chat about opportunities, feel free to reach out!"

    "text": "Experience\nI have hands-on experience with data analysis tools like R, SAS, and Excel, as well as programming experience in Java. Most of my data visualization work has been in R, where I use ggplot2 to turn complex datasets into clear, engaging visuals.\nDuring my time at CSUMB, I completed several projects that highlight my skills—from building statistical models and cleaning large datasets to creating interactive visualizations and sharing results through presentations. These projects show not only my technical abilities, but also my ability to communicate insights and solve real-world problems with data."

    "text": "Data Description: I sourced my data from kaggle. The website is here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rohitsahoo/sales-forecasting/data. My data has information on sales of a large retailer from 2015 through 2019. This includes customer information and location, information on what the customer purchased, and how much was spent on the purchase. I want answer the following questions:\n\nWhat type of products were the most purchased between 2015 and 2019?\nWhat state had the most products purchased?\nHow does the market in California look and has it changed?\nHow are sales distributed between different sub-categories?\n\nData Visualization: I want some sort of time series visualizations so that we can see changes over time. I am guessing a line graph or scatter plot will work well for this, with the date on the x-axis. For my second research question a bar chart will work. For my third research question I will have to visualize using a graph that shows proportion well. I wanted to do a sankey/alluvial plot for this one. Missing data shouldn’t be an issue.\nData Cleaning: The data set I am looking at has 9800 rows of information. I will need to fix the zip codes, some of them are missing and some only have 4 digits. I will need to manually fix this. After the zips are fixed, I will match the zip codes with data from the “zipdata” library, which has longitude and latitude information for each zip. I will also be looking at state and overall U.S. longitude and latitude coordinates so that I can answer question 2.\n\nData Cleaning\nThe data set required some fixing with the zip codes. Some of the easterly states who’s zip starts with zero mistakenly read in as only 4 digit zips. I had to put a zero at the front of every zip with that problem. On top of that, one of the cities had missing data for zip code, so I manually coded in the city’s zip. I used a package called “zipcode” which contains a data set with longitude and latitude coordinates for each zip code in the United States. I joined this data set with the original so that each observation had coordinates. I also used the “lubridate” package to format the shipping dates better.\n\n\nVisualizations 1 and 2\nResearch Question 1: What type of products were the most sold between 2015 and 2019?\nThe first two visualizations aim to answer my first research question, seen above. The visualization on the left shows the most sold sub-categories in order from least to most sold. You can see the two most sold products are phones and chairs. The next closest is storage, but the difference between them is quite large. The visualization on the right shows the most sold categories, in order from least to most sold. It is evident that technology sells the most.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizations 3, 4, 5, and 6\nResearch Question 2: What state has the most products purchased?\nThe next four visualizations aim to answer the above research question. The first visualization answers the research question, as you can clearly see California has the most total sales. This visualization and the next only show the states which are top 10 for total sales. The second visualization shows a map of the U.S. and the sales between each of the states. You can see there is a very high density for sales in California, and also states in the Northeast and Midwest. Since I found California had the most sales, I wanted to examine the sales within California to see if they were different than the country’s sales.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 7\nResearch Question 3: How does the market in California look and has it changed?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 8\nResearch Question 4: How are sales distributed between different sub-categories in California?"

You can see there is a very high density for sales in California, and also states in the Northeast and Midwest. Since I found California had the most sales, I wanted to examine the sales within California to see if they were different than the country’s sales. The order is relatively similar, phones and chairs hold the top two spots respectively. After examining the sub-categories of products, I decided to look into the hot-spots for sales in the state. My visual revealed most of the sales coming from the bay area, Los Angeles, and San Diego. Few sales came from the central valley.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 7\nResearch Question 3: How does the market in California look and has it changed?\nThe 7th visualization below aims to answer my third research question. The line graph shows how product categories sales have changed from 2015 to 2019. Furniture and technology move similar to one another, while office supplies act more sporadically. Sales have increased for each category since 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 8\nResearch Question 4: How are sales distributed between different sub-categories in California?\nThe 8th visualization aims to answer my fourth research question. The visual examines the different sale patterns within categories. Interestingly, office supplies has a lot of sales, but they are mostly low numbers. Furniture and technology have similar patterns, with technology having slightly higher sales but slightly less dense distribution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecommendation\nAfter careful examination of the data, I would recommend to any large superstore to sell either technology or furniture. These two product categories are more lucrative than office-supplies, and the demand has increases since the start year. I recommend opening stores in California, particularly near the bay area or southern California. Products like phones and chairs are best selling, so if you’re looking to make profits I’d recommend on focusing on one or the other."
